Can't stop, addicted 
to the shindig
Chop Top, he says 
I'm gonna win big
Choose not a 
life of imitation
Distant cousin to 
the reservation
efunct, the pistol 
that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' 
that you stay for
In time, I want to be 
your best friend
East Side love is living 
on the West End

Knocked out, but boy, 
you better come to            
Don't die, you know, 
the truth is some do
Go write your message on 
the pavement
Burn so bright, I wonder 
what the wave meant
White heat is 
screamin' in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 
50 belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding 
in the snow cone
So smart, she's 
leading me to ozone
Music, the great 
communicator
Use two sticks to 
make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, 
the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna 
be a close one
Smoke rings, I know 
you're gonna blow one
All on a spaceship, 
persevering
Use my hands for 
everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits 
when they need you
Mop tops are happy 
when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in 
the treetop
Birds that blow 
the meaning into bebop

The world I love, 
the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, 
can't stop
Ever wonder if 
it's all for you?
The world I love, 
the trains I hop
To be part of the wave,
can't stop
Come and tell me 
when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm 
passin' out, win or lose
Just like you
Far more shocking 
than anything I ever knew
How about you?
Ten more reasons 
why I need somebody new
Just like you
Far more shocking 
than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop, addicted 
to the shindig
Chop Top, he says 
I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin 
to the reservation
Defunct, the pistol 
that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' 
that you stay for
In time, I want to 
be your best friend
East Side love is 
living on the West End

Knocked out, but boy, 
you better come to
Don't die, you know, 
the truth is some do
Go write your message 
on the pavement
Burn so bright, I 
wonder what the wave meant

Kick-start the
golden generator
Sweet talk but
don't intimidate her
Can't stop the
gods from engineering
Feel no need for
any interfering
Your image in
the dictionary
This life is more
than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe 
even three of these?
Comin' from space to
teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits 
when they need you
This life is more than
just a read-through
